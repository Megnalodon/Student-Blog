    <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. 
      You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. 
      You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. 
      The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. 
      There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. 
      The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. 
      The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. 
      The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile. </p>

    <p>Unsinkable Disney does it again with an atmospheric romantic novela-esque film retelling the yearning of maturing wide-eyed teenage angst in the fairy tale land based on Hans Christian Andersen.
      Awesome. The sweeping broad encompassing sets are captivating.
      
      Tawny ships rock and tossled and drenched in mauves, steel gray waves,
      Glimmering shimmering flints of light filter through the oceans depth like a salty seaside Jane Erye escapist's paradise. 
      Dancing Crustaceans are precisioned and polished in synchronized like classic Busby Berkeley glamour razzle dazzle. Then we have cheerful everyday Tropical folk on a tropical island living the tropical life. Colorful confetti and papaya.
      
      This film is about hearing others.
      Walking through our feelings.
      Letting people grow and letting people go. Which entails making life decisions, good or bad, which leaves us open to be being easily lead and tricked in our search for ourselves by evil doers and opportunists. 
      In essence, our hearts are lonely hunters. This narrative is brilliant and is full of so much heart and soul searching.
      Disney the great story teller always in their narratives seem to keep the message clear that there is always something trying to quash our dreams and happiness. However if we rise above and persevere, maybe we can switch things up. Self effort is always needed.
      
      Now the actors. The performances are spot on. 
      Halle Bailey blithe and bright
      Javier Bardem immense gravitas extraordinare 
      Jonah Hauer-King dying for the modern romantic love
      Melissa Carthy aching brooding snippy and quippy 
      Perfect portrayals.
      
      Director Robert Marshall nails this interpretation with understanding the delicate balance between cartoon characters and humans. He doesn't marginalized Ariel...He gives her wings to soar. Eric to is a fuller young man. It would have been so easy to comicfy the human characterization, however, he romantically grounds them which allows us to live through them as oppose to live at them. So many films are "sexed it up", and smartly this film has that whimsical " Wizard of Oz" vibe.  This is such a subtle masterpiece in craft and execution.
      
      Phenomenal CGI. Just phenomenal. On par with Avatar.
      
      Finally, this a is a great family film.
      Lucky us
      Now, we can watched both versions of either the comical Little Mermaid or the coming of age Little Mermaid depending on our mood for comedy or romance. Or both, one after the other. Another wonderful day at the movies. </p>
